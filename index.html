                    <p id="kestrelText">
                        The Kestrel Project is a virtual reality simulation of the data collection and care of Kestrel birds found within the Treasure Valley of Boise, Idaho. The Raptor Research group at Boise State University approached GIMMWorks to create an interactive representation of what their volunteers do out in the field. In conjunction with one other developer and a couple of artists and 3D modelers, we constructed a realistic simulation from the ground up in a little over 2 months. My role was more in depth for this project, and I was able to give my input on how the application should be structured and built. I helped code and implement the systems for the application, visualizing the bigger picture of how all the mechanics fit together and feed into each other. I also helped implement the animations and interactions with the kestrel, integrating additive animations from our art team to give us developers more control over the bird's posing. Working on this project has taught me how important it is to roadmap and layout the plans for development early on, leaving nothing out of the planning phase. Listing out dependancies of different game mechanics made it easier to tackle different areas of the project without wasting time or cutting corners early just to get something working. The short time span of the project made the whole process feel like a sprint, but the depth of the application is quite impressive for the time we had. I am proud of what this project was able to become, and the part I had to play in its creation.

                    <h2>10 Different Scenarios to Train on!</h2>

                    <p id="fishandgameText">
                        I was brought onto GIMMWorks as a Unity Developer helping with the virtual reality side of the project, helping to integrate and debug the systems needed to get the hunting scenarios working. Other roles that I filled was level designer, using the terrain creator to sculpt out environments that the player and animals would be interacting with. Another role I helped with was voice actor, narrating the instructions and feedback for the player throughout the game. This project taught me so much about what it means to work on a development team, and understanding the production pipeline and what is necessary for components to cohesively fit together in the end. As a result, I had to adopt a strong attention to detail and throughness in my work, as I frequently was bringing things together in the end and getting the moving pieces to cooperate with each other. I had to gain a versatile knowledge base of the different team's workflows, making me able to differentiate what was ready to go or what had to be kicked back for revision. This kept the hiccups to a minimum, keeping the pipeline moving smoothly.

                        Rock, Paper, Blitzkrieg is a virtual reality game that uses hand tracking to transform the actions of the popular hand game into powerful attacks! This was a solo game development experience over the course of my third year in University. Everything from the mechanics, to sound design, to 3D models and animations were done by me using many different softwares. Virtual reality was daunting at first, but after completing the first iteration of this interactive experience, I'm much more prepared for other interactive experiences. My favorite part of the project was piecing all the parts of the game together, after having tested my game mechanics in a greyboxxed environment to test my code. Having went the extra mile and creating artistic assets like humanoid models, animations, and musical tracks, I understand the work pipeline that is necessary for assets to make it into production cohesively. Understanding how other branches of a game's development work allows workflow to operate without traffic jams. I'm proud of what was created in the time that I had and it was a great lesson for me!

                        A Thief's Delimma is an interactive comic that delves into the ideas of quantum mechanics, and
                        what they mean when extrapolated to real life.
                        Each section of the comic is unique in and of itself as it delves into various areas of quantum
                        mechanics, like entanglement and wave-particle duality.
                        Presenting such an abstract concept that most people have not heard of in a form that is
                        accessible to everyone was very challenging. Finding that balance between maintaining the ideas
                        from quantum mechanics,
                        but not dumbing it down enough to the point where the ideas are lost was not easy, but this
                        project is proof that it was possible. My position as lead story writer employed my years of
                        reading comics and fascination with narrative to the fullest extent.
                        I enjoyed working with the other group members and watching the ideas bounce of the walls as we
                        contemplated new ideas for where this project could go. To see all the elements of the comic
                        come together was a very fufilling experience, and to work on such a big project and having a
                        large role makes me proud to say I worked on this.

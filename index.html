                        This website serves as a mobile portfolio for anyone to view anytime, anywhere.
                        My name is Sam Lummus and I am going to Boise State University pursuing my
                        bachelorâ€™s degree in GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was introduced to video games through my grandmother, and ever since have been
                        enthralled with the challenge and experiences that they bring. I am an undergraduate
                        student currently and have delivered multiple projects in my time here, from solo
                        individual game projects to a collaborative comic about the theories of quantum physics.
                        My main interest right now is in virtual reality, and the potential it holds to bridge the
                        gap between user and experience, both for recreational and professional settings.

                        This was my first attempt at a full fledged game from the ground up. It is about a man on a
                        quest for a rare delicacy high on top of a mountain, but the path is perilous. Will he be able
                        to grab hold of this golden delight?
                        I chose to do a platform to exercise my love for creating interesting level design. I am a fan
                        of difficult video games already, so I wanted to make this one a challenge to beat.
                        Programming the jumping mechanic took a lot of time and tweaking in order to get it just right
                        for user controls and the design of the game.
                        I wanted the animations for the main character to be expressive for whatever action the player
                        makes the character do, and learning about animation transitions was eye opening.
                        I learned just how much effort and work goes into making a video game and makes me more
                        appreciative
                        of the ones I play myself.
                        What was fun was how much creative freedom I had with the way the game went; I had total control
                        over everything.

                        Jump Monke Jump is a 2 player competitive game where each player navigates an ever increasing
                        jungle
                        of traps until one can no longer continue forward.
                        Augemented Reality is always changing, and this collaborative project felt impossible at some
                        times.
                        We wanted to make a game that could be laid over the real world utilizing the cameras on
                        smartphones.
                        The idea of a head-to-head game where you see how far each other can go came to us when we
                        discussed
                        what made a game replayable.
                        This game itself is quite simple at first, but as the game continues, it gets more and more
                        complex.
                        All the aspects of the game were carefully thought over for what would create the best possible
                        experience on a phone.

                        Rock, Paper, Blitzkrieg is a virtual reality game that uses hand tracking to transform the actions of the popular hand game
                        into powerful attacks! This was a solo game development experience over the course of my third year in University.
                        Everything from the mechanics, to sound design, to 3D models and animations were done by me using many different softwares.
                        Virtual reality was daunting at first, but after completing the first iteration of this interactive experience, I'm much more
                        prepared for other interactive experiences. My favorite part of the project was piecing all the parts of the game together,
                        after having tested my game mechanics in a greyboxxed environment to test my code. Having went the extra mile and creating
                        artistic assets like humanoid models, animations, and musical tracks, I understand the work pipeline that is necessary for
                        assets to make it into production cohesively. Understanding how other branches of a game's development work allows workflow
                        to operate without traffic jams. I'm proud of what was created in the time that I had and it was a great lesson for me!

                        A Thief's Delimma is an interactive comic that delves into the ideas of quantum mechanics, and
                        what they mean when extrapolated to real life.
                        Each section of the comic is unique in and of itself as it delves into various areas of quantum
                        mechanics, like entanglement and wave-particle duality.
                        Presenting such an abstract concept that most people have not heard of in a form that is
                        accessible to everyone was very challenging. Finding that balance between maintaining the ideas
                        from quantum mechanics,
                        but not dumbing it down enough to the point where the ideas are lost was not easy, but this
                        project is proof that it was possible. My position as lead story writer employed my years of
                        reading comics and fascination with narrative to the fullest extent.
                        I enjoyed working with the other group members and watching the ideas bounce of the walls as we
                        contemplated new ideas for where this project could go. To see all the elements of the comic
                        come together was a very fufilling experience, and to work on such a big project and having a
                        large role makes me proud to say I worked on this.

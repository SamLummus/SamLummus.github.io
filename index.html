            <h1>Sam Lummus</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website that serves as a way for you to view what projects I have worked on and what I
                contributed to them.
                My name is Sam Lummus and I am going to Boise State University pursuing my bacholer's degree in GIMM
                (Game, Interactive Media, and Mobile).
                My native land is southern California, but I moved to Idaho after I graduated high school. I have been
                in
                Idaho for a couple years now, but I love it already.
                I have always been around technology and video games, as they have always interested me.
                I am a second year student currently and have delivered a couple of projects in my time here, which have
                taught me a lot about technical skills as well as important social skills when it comes to working in a
                group.
                I have worked with Unity game engine, C#, Java, and skills in Adobe Photoshop, Animate, and Illustrator.
                I
                am always eager to work on my next learning experience.

                    <h2>
                        Golden Delight
                    </h2>
                    <p id="text">
                        This was my first attempt at a full fledged game from the ground up. It is about a man on a
                        quest for a rare delicacy high on top of a mountain, but the path is perilous. Will he be able
                        to grab hold of this golden delight?
                        I chose to do a platform to exercise my love for creating interesting level design. I am a fan
                        of difficult video games already, so I wanted to make this one a challenge to beat.
                        Programming the jumping mechanic took a lot of time and tweaking in order to get it just right
                        for user controls and the design of the game.
                        I wanted the animations for the main character to be expressive for whatever action the player
                        makes the character do, and learning about animation transitions was eye opening.
                        I learned just how much effort and work goes into making a video game and makes me more
                        appreciative
                        of the ones I play myself.
                        What was fun was how much creative freedom I had with the way the game went; I had total control
                        over everything.

                    <p>
                        Jump Monke Jump is a 2 player competitive game where each player navigates an ever increasing
                        jungle
                        of traps until one can no longer continue forward.
                        Augemented Reality is always changing, and this collaborative project felt impossible at some
                        times.
                        We wanted to make a game that could be laid over the real world utilizing the cameras on
                        smartphones.
                        The idea of a head-to-head game where you see how far each other can go came to us when we
                        discussed
                        what made a game replayable.
                        This game itself is quite simple at first, but as the game continues, it gets more and more
                        complex.
                        All the aspects of the game were carefully thought over for what would create the best possible
                        experience on a phone.

                    <h2>
                        RUMBLER
                    </h2>
                    <p id="uxText">
                        RUMBLER is a fake app showcasing UX that is a combination of similar augmented reality games
                        like
                        Pokemon Go or Ingress and street fighting.
                        The idea was to create a comfortable user experience through an app interface, with intuitive
                        buttons and design choices.
                        The app simulates a user who can check the local gyms to see if anybody wants to fight. These
                        gyms
                        are essentially sanctioned fighting grounds, and if a player wins a match against someone, their
                        rank through the app goes up.
                        The user's profile is chock full of stats about their time on the app and their matches won or
                        lost.
                        It is a cross between a social media app and a sort of underground fighting ring.
                        The global leaderboard is what I think a lot of player's strive for in games, so the inclusion
                        of
                        that alongside a sorting method allows players to see how they stack up against their peers.
                        This fake app was a lot of fun to make, and allowed me to exercise my full creativity not only
                        as a
                        designer, but as an extension of my personality.

                    <p>
                        A Thief's Delimma is an interactive comic that delves into the ideas of quantum mechanics, and
                        what they mean when extrapolated to real life.
                        Each section of the comic is unique in and of itself as it delves into various areas of quantum
                        mechanics, like entanglement and wave-particle duality.
                        Presenting such an abstract concept that most people have not heard of in a form that is
                        accessible to everyone was very challenging. Finding that balance between maintaining the ideas
                        from quantum mechanics,
                        but not dumbing it down enough to the point where the ideas are lost was not easy, but this
                        project is proof that it was possible. My position as lead story writer employed my years of
                        reading comics and fascination with narrative to the fullest extent.
                        I enjoyed working with the other group members and watching the ideas bounce of the walls as we
                        contemplated new ideas for where this project could go. To see all the elements of the comic
                        come together was a very fufilling experience, and to work on such a big project and having a
                        large role makes me proud to say I worked on this.

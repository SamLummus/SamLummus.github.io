                        This was my first attempt at a full fledged game from the ground up. It is about a man on a
                        quest for a rare delicacy high on top of a mountain, but the path is perilous. Will he be able
                        to grab hold of this golden delight?
                        I chose to do a platform to exercise my love for creating interesting level design. I am a fan
                        of difficult video games already, so I wanted to make this one a challenge to beat.
                        Programming the jumping mechanic took a lot of time and tweaking in order to get it just right
                        for user controls and the design of the game.
                        I wanted the animations for the main character to be expressive for whatever action the player
                        makes the character do, and learning about animation transitions was eye opening.
                        I learned just how much effort and work goes into making a video game and makes me more
                        appreciative
                        of the ones I play myself.
                        What was fun was how much creative freedom I had with the way the game went; I had total control
                        over everything.

                        Jump Monke Jump is a 2 player competitive game where each player navigates an ever increasing
                        jungle
                        of traps until one can no longer continue forward.
                        Augemented Reality is always changing, and this collaborative project felt impossible at some
                        times.
                        We wanted to make a game that could be laid over the real world utilizing the cameras on
                        smartphones.
                        The idea of a head-to-head game where you see how far each other can go came to us when we
                        discussed
                        what made a game replayable.
                        This game itself is quite simple at first, but as the game continues, it gets more and more
                        complex.
                        All the aspects of the game were carefully thought over for what would create the best possible
                        experience on a phone.

                        This is a completely solo game that takes the idea of rock, paper, scissors and imagines if each move you did had actual affect on your opponent.
                        The game uses virtual reality to put the player in the game itself, having the player's use only their hands to interact with the environment and game mechanics.
                        Using the XR Hands package, custom gestures were made to hold true to the game of rock, paper, scissors, where each gesture activates an attack to fend off waves of enemies.
                        As this is a solo project, my game development skills are stretched to their limits, but incredibly rewarding. Each next step in the project seemed to pose a challenge to my vision for my game.
                        The VR technology is tempermental, even moreso with XR Hands, it felt like every little change broke something. 
                        The enemy's that come at the player are behaviorally different, and can only be taken out by the correct attacks, and this is the fundamental gameplay of Rock, Paper, Blitzkrieg.
                        Juggle attacking the enemies before they take you out, choosing the correct attacks to do so. The enemies are handled by spawner objects, done so in mind to make the level building modular.
                        I can't wait to further develop this game and build more unique levels for people to play in!

                        A Thief's Delimma is an interactive comic that delves into the ideas of quantum mechanics, and
                        what they mean when extrapolated to real life.
                        Each section of the comic is unique in and of itself as it delves into various areas of quantum
                        mechanics, like entanglement and wave-particle duality.
                        Presenting such an abstract concept that most people have not heard of in a form that is
                        accessible to everyone was very challenging. Finding that balance between maintaining the ideas
                        from quantum mechanics,
                        but not dumbing it down enough to the point where the ideas are lost was not easy, but this
                        project is proof that it was possible. My position as lead story writer employed my years of
                        reading comics and fascination with narrative to the fullest extent.
                        I enjoyed working with the other group members and watching the ideas bounce of the walls as we
                        contemplated new ideas for where this project could go. To see all the elements of the comic
                        come together was a very fufilling experience, and to work on such a big project and having a
                        large role makes me proud to say I worked on this.
